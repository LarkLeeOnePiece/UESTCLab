# UESTC Lab
This is the demo for forward kinematic and inverse kinematics.

## FK(Forward kinematic)
1. scene graph rendering

## Buffer Usage
### 1. float buffer
FloatBuffer[0]: angle 1 for one joint 1

FloatBuffer[1]: angle 2 for one joint 2

...

save 10 space for more joint angles

From FloatBuffer[10]: start to save the Jacobian matrixï¼Œ In this case, we have two angles

### 2. Inverse process
Since we need to calculate the jacobian first, then transform,so we need to define two frame

Use the IntBuffer to define different frame, then iterate the frame between 0/1.

We calcule the jacobian at frame 0 and use it at frame 1

If pixel.xy==(0,0) and frame=0, calculate the jacobian

    frame=(frame+1)%2

else if frame==1, render the result
